# ParallelAlgorithms

In this repository are some algorithms I wished to highlight experience coding. In here are multiple classic Parallel Data Structures and Algorithms such as a
Concurrent HashMap, parallel MatrixMapReduce Framework, and parallel solution counter for the classic NQueens problem.
